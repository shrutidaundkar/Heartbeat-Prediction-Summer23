# Heartbeat-Prediction-Summer23
- Introduction:

	In the contemporary era, cardiovascular diseases, including heart strokes, have emerged as common health concerns. Unhealthy food habits and the consumption of processed foods have been identified as significant factors 	contributing to this alarming trend. Advanced Machine Learning techniques have shown promising applications in the healthcare domain. This project aims to explore the effectiveness of Machine Learning models in 				predicting heartbeats accurately using medical data. Specifically, we will compare the performance of Random Forest Regression and CatBoost models for this predictive task.
